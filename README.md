# ADA-Staking
Cardano (ADA) Staking Pool

A truly decentralized staking pool with a hybrid solution implementing a block producer and a main relay node in a basement server in Zurich (powered with renewable energy) and a backup relay on a data center in Germany.

Hosted in Switzerland and Germany and operated by a cool vegan software engineer. 

We strive to sustainibly decentralize the Cardano ecosystem

We use ASUS Mini PCs PN40 with 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD.

GranADA helps refugee families in countries with humanitarian crisis by monthly supporting to the [World Food Programm](https://sharethemeal.org/en/table.html)

We also focus on educating and informing the Spanish-speaking community about blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem.

Thank you for your trust and for joining the blockchain revolution!
