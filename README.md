# ADA-Staking
Cardano (ADA) Staking Pool


A truly decentralized staking pool operated by a cool vegan software engineer with a hybrid solution implementing a block producer and a main relay node on private servers in Zurich, Switzerland (powered with renewable energy) and a backup relay on a data center in Germany. This pool uses ASUS Mini PCs PN40 with 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD.

We strive to sustainibly decentralize the Cardano ecosystem

GranADA helps refugee families in countries with humanitarian crisis by monthly supporting to the [World Food Programm](https://sharethemeal.org/en/table.html).

We also focus on educating and informing the Spanish-speaking community about blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem.

Thank you for your trust and for delegating kindness with us!
